    "The purpose of deep learning is to learn a representation of high dimensional and noisy data using a sequence of differentiable functions, i.e., geometric transformations, that can perhaps be used for supervised learning tasks among others. It has had great success in discriminative models while generative models have fared worse due to the limitations of explicit maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Adversarial learning as presented in the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) aims to overcome these problems by using implicit MLE. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the MNIST computer vision dataset and a synthetic financial transactions dataset for an insurance task for these experiments. GAN is a remarkably different method of learning compared to explicit MLE. Our purpose will be to show that the representation learnt by a GAN can be used for supervised learning tasks such as image recognition and insurance loss risk prediction. In this manner we avoid the manual process of handcrafted feature engineering by learning a set of features automatically, i.e., representation learning."

    "We have shown how to use GANs to learn a good representation of raw data, i.e., 1 or 2 dimensional tensors per unit of analysis, that can then perhaps be used for supervised learning tasks in the domain of computer vision and insurance. This moves us away from manual handcrafted feature engineering towards automatic feature engineering, i.e., representation learning. GANs can perhaps be also used for semi-supervised learning which will be the topic of another paper."
